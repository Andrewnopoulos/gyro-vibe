Bug Fix Instructions for Multiplayer Spellcasting Issue
Problem Summary:

In your multiplayer spellcasting system, a bug causes spells cast by one player to appear as if they’re cast by another player from their perspective. This happens due to synchronization issues where the client-side code incorrectly uses the local player’s perspective for remote spell casts.

Root Cause:

When a player casts a spell, the server broadcasts the event to all clients. However, the client-side code fails to properly use the remote player’s position and direction, instead defaulting to the local player’s camera data, making spells appear to originate from the wrong source.

Solution Overview:

To fix this, ensure remote spells use the casting player’s position and direction, not the local player’s camera. This requires updating how player data is managed and used in the spell system.

Step-by-Step Plan to Fix the Bug
Step 1: Enhance Remote Player Data in GameStateManager
Goal: Make sure GameStateManager tracks and provides accurate position and orientation data for remote players.
Actions:
Update the handleStateUpdate method in GameStateManager to store each player’s full data, including:
position (as a THREE.Vector3)
rotation (as a quaternion)
Add helper methods:
getPlayerPosition(playerId): Returns the player’s position as a THREE.Vector3.
getPlayerForwardDirection(playerId): Returns the player’s forward direction as a THREE.Vector3 based on their rotation.
Why:
Reliable access to remote player data is essential for positioning spells correctly on the client side.
Step 2: Update SpellRegistry to Use Reliable Player Data
Goal: Ensure SpellRegistry fetches accurate position and direction for remote spells from GameStateManager.
Actions:
Modify handleRemoteSpellCast in SpellRegistry to:
Call GameStateManager.getPlayerPosition(playerId) and GameStateManager.getPlayerForwardDirection(playerId) for the remote player.
Use these values to set context.cameraPosition and context.targetDirection if not provided by the network event.
Update EventBus to support these calls with events like:
'multiplayer:get-player-position'
'multiplayer:get-player-direction'
Why:
This prevents the spell system from defaulting to the local camera by ensuring it always has the remote player’s data.
Step 3: Fix Spell-Specific Remote Casting Logic
Goal: Update individual spell classes to use provided remote player data instead of local camera fallbacks.
Actions:
For LaserBeamSpell:
Update fireRemoteLaser to use context.cameraPosition and context.targetDirection directly.
Remove any code that falls back to the local camera’s position or direction.
For ObjectSpawnerSpell:
Update spawnChanneledObject to use context.cameraPosition and context.targetDirection for remote casts.
Ensure local camera data is only used for local casts, not remote ones.
Why:
Eliminating local camera fallbacks ensures remote spells are visualized from the correct player’s perspective.
Step 4: Verify Server Data Integrity
Goal: Confirm the server sends accurate position and direction data for spell casts.
Actions:
In the server-side code (e.g., index.js), check the spell-cast event payload includes:
cameraPosition: The casting player’s position.
targetDirection: The casting player’s forward direction.
Ensure clients send this data accurately when casting spells locally.
Why:
The client relies on correct server data to position remote spells properly.
Step 5: Test and Debug
Goal: Validate the fix by ensuring spells appear to originate from the correct player.
Actions:
Test with two players:
Player A casts a spell; Player B should see it originate from Player A’s position.
Add debug logs in fireRemoteLaser and spawnChanneledObject to output:
context.cameraPosition
context.targetDirection
If the bug persists, check for network delays or missing player data updates in GameStateManager.
Why:
Testing confirms the fix works, and logs help pinpoint any remaining issues.
Summary
The bug occurs because the spell system uses the local player’s camera for remote casts when remote player data is missing or ignored. By improving GameStateManager to provide accurate player data, updating SpellRegistry to use it, and fixing spell-specific logic to avoid local camera fallbacks, you’ll ensure spells appear correctly. Implement these steps sequentially and test after each to resolve the issue.
