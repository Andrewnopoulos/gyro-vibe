## Rune Mode Feature - Implemented!

The Rune Mode feature has been successfully implemented, allowing players to toggle between standard control mode and a special "rune drawing" mode for casting magical effects by drawing shapes.

### Feature Overview:
- Desktop players can press the Q key to toggle rune mode on/off
- When rune mode is active:
  - Visual indicators appear on both desktop and mobile interfaces
  - The mobile touch input is used for drawing shapes instead of rotating the view
  - A canvas visualization shows the touch path as it's being drawn
  - Shape recognition system detects circles and triangles
  - Successful shape recognition triggers visual effects on both devices

## Implementation Details

### 1. ✅ Key Handling in FirstPersonController
- Added 'Q' key detection to toggle rune mode
- Implemented runeMode boolean flag to track state
- Created toggleRuneMode method with proper event emissions
- Added visual UI indicator on desktop view when rune mode is active
- Implemented effects for recognized shapes (shield, fireball, particles)

### 2. ✅ Visual Indicator on Phone Model
- Added glowing visual indicator to the 3D phone model
- Implemented animations for the rune mode indicator
- Connected indicator to the rune mode toggle events
- Created smooth transitions between modes

### 3. ✅ Touch Input Handling
- Updated TouchController to handle different modes
- Implemented path capturing in rune mode
- Created touch point storage for shape analysis
- Added event emissions for path data

### 4. ✅ Touch Path Visualization
- Added canvas overlay for drawing on mobile
- Implemented glowing path visualization
- Added trailing effect for better visual feedback
- Implemented touch path clearing after shape recognition

### 5. ✅ Shape Recognition System
- Implemented algorithms for detecting:
  - Circles (using circularity score)
  - Triangles (using angle detection)
- Added confidence scoring for recognition
- Created thresholds to handle imprecise drawing
- Implemented event system for recognized shapes

### 6. ✅ Desktop-Mobile Communication
- Updated WebRTC manager to handle rune mode events
- Enhanced Socket.IO manager with rune events
- Implemented server-side handling of rune events
- Created bidirectional communication for shape recognition

### 7. ✅ User Feedback System
- Added visual feedback for recognized shapes
- Implemented notifications on both desktop and mobile
- Created visual effects for different recognized shapes
- Added animations for successful shape recognition

### 8. ✅ Mobile Game Manager Integration
- Added rune mode handling to MobileGameManager
- Implemented shape visualization on mobile device
- Created effects for recognized runes
- Added game state tracking for rune mode

### Next Improvement Ideas
- Add more complex shapes (squares, stars, etc.)
- Implement practical game effects for each rune shape
- Add sound effects for drawing and successful recognition
- Create tutorial for introducing the rune system to players
- Optimize shape recognition for better accuracy


# Physics and Gravity Gun Implementation Plan

Please implement a physics system with multiplayer-synchronized rigidbodies and a gravity gun feature. The gravity gun should allow desktop players to pick up physics objects by pointing their gyro controller at them and pressing E.

## Requirements

1. Create a physics system using Cannon.js
2. Make physics objects visible and synchronized in multiplayer
3. Implement a gravity gun that locks objects to the gyro controller when activated

## Implementation Steps

1. Add Cannon.js to the project dependencies
2. Create a PhysicsManager class to handle the physics simulation
3. Create a GravityGunController class to manage object picking/dropping
4. Update the networking code to synchronize physics state
5. Add server-side handlers for physics events

## Code Structure

Please implement the following classes:

1. `PhysicsManager`: Main physics system that simulates rigidbodies
2. `GravityGunController`: Handles raycast detection and object manipulation
3. Update `GameStateManager` to handle physics synchronization

## Detailed Class Requirements

### PhysicsManager

- Initialize a Cannon.js physics world
- Create, update and manage physics objects
- Synchronize visual meshes with physics bodies
- Track held objects and apply forces to move them
- Emit network events for multiplayer synchronization

### GravityGunController

- Cast rays from the phone/weapon to detect physics objects
- Implement pickup/drop with E key
- Create visual beam effect when holding objects
- Update held object position based on phone orientation
- Support all existing gyroscope functionality

### Network Synchronization

- Send physics object states periodically
- Handle object creation events
- Synchronize object pickup/drop between clients
- Update server to relay physics events

## Additional Notes

- Each physics object should have a unique ID for tracking across the network
- Use interpolation for smooth remote object movement
- Create different object types and colors for visual variety
- Add the physics system to the app initialization code
- The existing gyroscope controller should remain fully functional
