Multiplayer Integration Plan: Spell Casts and Enemy Synchronization
Phase 1: Analysis and Architecture (1-2 days)

Review Current Multiplayer System

Examine GameStateManager, SocketManager, and PlayerManager to understand how position/rotation data are currently synchronized
Identify the event flow between clients and server
Map out how physics objects are currently synchronized (if at all)


Define Synchronization Requirements

Specify which spell properties need synchronization (type, target, damage, visual effects)
Define enemy properties to synchronize (position, health, attack state, targeting)
Identify potential network optimization needs (e.g., update frequency, data compression)


Design Extension Points

Plan how to extend the current network protocol
Design new event types for enemy state and spell casting
Create serialization format for spell and enemy data



Phase 2: Server-Side Implementation (2-3 days)

Extend Socket.IO Event Handlers

Add spell-cast event handler on server
Add enemy-update and enemy-damage event handlers
Add enemy-spawn and enemy-death event handlers


Implement Server-Side Validation

Add basic validation for spell casting (cooldowns, range checks)
Add validation for enemy damage (prevent cheating)
Implement server authority for critical gameplay actions


Create Room-Based Broadcasting

Implement broadcast mechanism for spell effects to all room members
Create efficient enemy state broadcasting (consider delta encoding)
Add game state reconciliation for late-joining players



Phase 3: Client-Side Implementation (3-4 days)

Extend SpellRegistry and Spell Classes

Modify spell casting to emit network events
Add network event listeners for remote spell casts
Implement visual effects for remote player spell casts


Enhance EnemyManager

Add network event emission for enemy spawning/state/damage
Implement remote enemy state application
Add interpolation for smooth enemy movement across network
Create reconciliation mechanism for enemy health


Update Gravity Gun/Physics Objects

Ensure consistent behavior with networked spell effects
Synchronize physical interactions with enemies



Phase 4: UI and Feedback (1-2 days)

Add Visual Indicators

Create visual feedback for remote player spell casts
Add indicators for networked damage sources
Implement "spell hit" animations that work across network


Enhance In-Game Notifications

Add notifications for remote player kills
Show spell effects from other players
Display team damage statistics



Phase 5: Testing and Optimization (2-3 days)

Implement Testing Framework

Create test scenarios for synchronized spell casting
Test edge cases (disconnections during spell casts, etc.)
Validate behavior with multiple clients


Optimize Network Traffic

Analyze bandwidth usage and optimize packet size
Implement delta compression for enemy state updates
Add priority system for critical vs. non-critical updates


Refine Synchronization Logic

Tune update frequency based on testing results
Optimize server-side validation
Implement prediction/reconciliation for smoother gameplay



Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment (1-2 days)

Update Code Documentation

Document all new network events and their payload formats
Create sequence diagrams for synchronized gameplay actions
Document potential edge cases and their handling


Create Deployment Plan

Outline server capacity requirements
Define rollout strategy
Create monitoring plan for network performance


Prepare Release Notes

Document new multiplayer features for players
Highlight known limitations
Provide troubleshooting guidance



Key Implementation Details
New Socket Events to Implement:
Copy// Client to Server
'spell-cast': { spellId, targetPosition, targetId? }
'enemy-damage': { enemyId, damage, sourceType, sourceId }

// Server to Clients
'remote-spell-cast': { playerId, spellId, targetPosition, targetId? }
'enemy-spawn': { enemyId, type, position, health }
'enemy-update': { enemyId, position?, health?, state? }
'enemy-death': { enemyId, killerPlayerId? }
Main Files to Modify:

Server-side:

server/socket-handler.js (add new event handlers)
server/room-manager.js (extend room state to include enemies)
server/game-state.js (add spell and enemy synchronization)


Client-side:

client/js/game/game-state-manager.js (add new event handlers)
client/js/game/spells/spell.js (extend with network functionality)
client/js/game/enemy-system/enemy-manager.js (add network synchronization)
client/js/game/spells/spell-effects.js (handle remote spell effects)



This plan provides a structured approach to implementing multiplayer spell casting and enemy synchronization. Once completed, you'll have a more cohesive multiplayer experience where players can see each other's spells and fight enemies together.
