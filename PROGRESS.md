## Rune Mode Feature - Implemented!

The Rune Mode feature has been successfully implemented, allowing players to toggle between standard control mode and a special "rune drawing" mode for casting magical effects by drawing shapes.

### Feature Overview:
- Desktop players can press the Q key to toggle rune mode on/off
- When rune mode is active:
  - Visual indicators appear on both desktop and mobile interfaces
  - The mobile touch input is used for drawing shapes instead of rotating the view
  - A canvas visualization shows the touch path as it's being drawn
  - Shape recognition system detects circles and triangles
  - Successful shape recognition triggers visual effects on both devices

## Implementation Details

### 1. ✅ Key Handling in FirstPersonController
- Added 'Q' key detection to toggle rune mode
- Implemented runeMode boolean flag to track state
- Created toggleRuneMode method with proper event emissions
- Added visual UI indicator on desktop view when rune mode is active
- Implemented effects for recognized shapes (shield, fireball, particles)

### 2. ✅ Visual Indicator on Phone Model
- Added glowing visual indicator to the 3D phone model
- Implemented animations for the rune mode indicator
- Connected indicator to the rune mode toggle events
- Created smooth transitions between modes

### 3. ✅ Touch Input Handling
- Updated TouchController to handle different modes
- Implemented path capturing in rune mode
- Created touch point storage for shape analysis
- Added event emissions for path data

### 4. ✅ Touch Path Visualization
- Added canvas overlay for drawing on mobile
- Implemented glowing path visualization
- Added trailing effect for better visual feedback
- Implemented touch path clearing after shape recognition

### 5. ✅ Shape Recognition System
- Implemented algorithms for detecting:
  - Circles (using circularity score)
  - Triangles (using angle detection)
- Added confidence scoring for recognition
- Created thresholds to handle imprecise drawing
- Implemented event system for recognized shapes

### 6. ✅ Desktop-Mobile Communication
- Updated WebRTC manager to handle rune mode events
- Enhanced Socket.IO manager with rune events
- Implemented server-side handling of rune events
- Created bidirectional communication for shape recognition

### 7. ✅ User Feedback System
- Added visual feedback for recognized shapes
- Implemented notifications on both desktop and mobile
- Created visual effects for different recognized shapes
- Added animations for successful shape recognition

### 8. ✅ Mobile Game Manager Integration
- Added rune mode handling to MobileGameManager
- Implemented shape visualization on mobile device
- Created effects for recognized runes
- Added game state tracking for rune mode

### Next Improvement Ideas
- Add more complex shapes (squares, stars, etc.)
- Implement practical game effects for each rune shape
- Add sound effects for drawing and successful recognition
- Create tutorial for introducing the rune system to players
- Optimize shape recognition for better accuracy



# ALERT
- I think that the visual effects are being applied to the wrong device. When i disconnected my phone I saw that the phone in the main scene had a rune effect applied to it, while the one in first person view did not. I need the rune effects to be applied to the mobile device that is used as the first-person "weapon". I think it's the one in weapon-view.js. That all should probably be renamed since calling it a "weapon" probably isn't accurate.
