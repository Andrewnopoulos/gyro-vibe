# Gyro-Vibe Project Progress

## WebRTC Implementation - March 10, 2025

### Overview
The Gyro-Vibe application has been successfully refactored to use WebRTC instead of WebSockets for transmitting sensor data. This change promises to significantly reduce latency in the system, making the gyroscope visualization more responsive.

### Changes Made

#### Server Changes (server/index.js)
- Converted from a data relay to a WebRTC signaling server
- Implemented session-based pairing between desktop and mobile clients
- Added UUID package for generating unique session identifiers
- Implemented signaling mechanisms for WebRTC (offer/answer/ICE candidates)
- Maintained backward compatibility for environments without WebRTC

#### Desktop Client Changes (client/js/client.js)
- Implemented WebRTC peer connection initialization and management
- Added data channel for direct communication with mobile devices
- Updated QR code generation to include session IDs
- Modified UI to reflect WebRTC connection states
- Added fallback to WebSockets when WebRTC connection fails

#### Mobile Client Changes (client/mobile.html)
- Added WebRTC connection setup and management
- Implemented session-based pairing mechanism
- Created data channel for sending sensor data directly to desktop
- Reduced transmission interval from 50ms to 33ms for better responsiveness
- Added appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Latency**: Direct peer-to-peer communication eliminates server relay, reducing latency in sensor data transmission.

2. **Lower Server Load**: With WebRTC, the server only handles signaling and initial connection setup. All sensor data flows directly between clients.

3. **Improved Multi-User Support**: Session-based pairing ensures that mobile devices connect to the correct desktop clients, allowing multiple users to use the application simultaneously without interference.

4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to WebSockets maintains compatibility with browsers that don't support WebRTC.

### Testing Instructions

To test the WebRTC implementation locally:

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Access the desktop client at http://localhost:3000

3. The QR code on the desktop client includes a unique session ID that pairs the mobile device to the specific desktop client.

4. For testing on a real mobile device, ensure both devices are on the same network and use the HTTPS URL (https://your.ip.address:3443/mobile?session=...) visible in the desktop client.

5. Connection states are displayed in the UI and additional details are logged to the browser console.

### Next Steps

1. **Performance Testing**: Quantify the latency improvement with WebRTC vs WebSockets.

2. **NAT Traversal Enhancement**: Consider adding TURN server configuration for cases where direct peer connections fail due to network restrictions.

3. **Connection Quality Indicators**: Add visual indicators to show the quality and latency of the WebRTC connection.

4. **Reconnection Logic**: Enhance the automatic reconnection logic when connections are temporarily lost.
