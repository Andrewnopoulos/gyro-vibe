# Spellbook Implementation Plan

Here's a detailed plan to implement the spellbook functionality with multiple spells, page turning, and instructions:

## Step 1: Design the Spellbook Data Structure

Create a data structure to store spell information:
1. Define a `Spell` class or interface with:
   - Shape required (circle, triangle, etc.)
   - Name of the spell
   - Description of the effect
   - Visual representation for the book page (potentially)
   - Callback/function to execute when cast
   - Any additional spell-specific properties

2. Create a `SpellRegistry` or similar to maintain the collection of available spells:
   - This would be a central store for all available spells
   - Should allow easy addition of new spells
   - Should assign each spell to a specific page number

3. Create a special instruction page that's not a spell but provides game instructions

## Step 2: Enhance the WeaponView to Support Multiple Pages

1. Modify the `WeaponView` class to track the current page number
2. Update the page flip animations to:
   - Track which page is currently visible
   - Restrict page turning at the beginning/end of the book
   - Update the visual content when a page transition completes
   - Ensure page content updates after animation completes
   - Start the book on the instruction page by default

3. Refine the visual representation of the book pages:
   - Create left and right page content areas
   - Add page number display
   - Improve texture or appearance of pages

## Step 3: Create the Page Content Renderer

1. Create a method to render content on the book pages:
   - Text rendering system for spell name and description
   - Shape visualization on the left page
   - Spell description on the right page
   - Special formatting for the instruction page

2. Create distinct page templates for:
   - Instruction page (default opening page)
   - Spell pages showing the required shape and description

3. Implement a texture generation system to create and update page textures:
   - Use canvas to generate textures for spell pages
   - Create distinct visual appearance for different spell types

## Step 4: Connect Spell Casting to Rune Recognition

1. Modify the rune recognition system to check:
   - If the drawn shape matches the shape of the spell on the current page
   - If not, provide feedback that the wrong shape was drawn or wrong page is open
   - If matches, trigger the spell casting

2. Implement spell activation logic:
   - Retrieve the correct spell based on the current page
   - Handle missing/null cases for safety
   - Call the appropriate spell effect function
   - Show visual feedback when a spell is cast successfully

3. Add visual/audio feedback:
   - Display indication when correct shape is drawn on correct page
   - Provide different feedback when wrong shape is drawn
   - Show error when trying to cast on instruction page

## Step 5: Implement Basic Spells

1. Create several initial spells with different shapes:
   - Circle spell (e.g., shield or protection)
   - Triangle spell (e.g., fire or attack)
   - Square spell (e.g., trap or construct)
   - More complex shapes for advanced spells

2. For each spell, add:
   - Placeholder effect (with TODO markers)
   - Shape recognition pattern
   - Descriptive text for the spellbook

3. Create the instruction page content explaining:
   - How to turn pages using Q/E keys
   - How to draw shapes with the mobile device
   - Basic game controls
   - Overview of spell types

## Step 6: Add Extension and Management Systems

1. Create a registration system for new spells:
   - Method to add new spells at runtime
   - Proper ordering/pagination when spells are added
   - Validation to prevent duplicate spells or shapes

2. Add spell progression/unlocking system (optional):
   - Track which spells are available to the player
   - Show "locked" pages for spells not yet available
   - Implement unlock criteria

3. Create a configuration system for spells:
   - Allow adjusting spell properties (power, cooldown, etc.)
   - Support loading spell definitions from config files

## Step 7: Update Input Handling and UI Integration

1. Ensure page turning input controls work correctly:
   - Confirm Q/E keys navigate correctly
   - Add visual feedback during page turns
   - Prevent turning during animations

2. Add UI indicators:
   - Show current page number
   - Indicate when a spell is ready to cast
   - Display cooldown timers if applicable
   - Provide visual feedback on shape recognition

3. Update the mobile controller to:
   - Send appropriate shape data
   - Show feedback on the mobile device

## Step 8: Optimize and Polish

1. Optimize texture generation:
   - Pre-generate textures where possible
   - Only update textures when needed
   - Implement proper texture memory management

2. Add visual polish:
   - Page turn sound effects
   - Particle effects for successful cast
   - Improved page textures
   - Magical glyphs or symbols on pages

3. Handle edge cases:
   - Handle rapid page turns
   - Manage memory for textures
   - Gracefully handle missing spell definitions

## Step 9: Testing and User Experience

1. Test all spell combinations
2. Ensure proper feedback when:
   - Correct shape is drawn on correct page
   - Correct shape is drawn on wrong page
   - Wrong shape is drawn
   - Page is turned during drawing

3. Validate that new spells can be easily added
4. Test performance with multiple spell textures

## Implementation Details

### Spell Data Structure Example
```javascript
{
  id: "fire_blast",
  name: "Fire Blast",
  shape: "triangle",
  description: "Conjures a powerful blast of fire that damages enemies",
  page: 3,
  icon: "fire_icon",
  effect: function() {
    // TODO: Implement fire blast effect
  }
}
```

### Page Tracking
```javascript
// In WeaponView class
this.currentPage = 0; // Start with instruction page (0)
this.totalPages = 5; // Including instruction page
this.spellRegistry = new SpellRegistry();

// When flipping left
if (this.currentPage > 0) {
  this.currentPage--;
  this.startFlipLeft();
  this.updatePageContent();
}

// When flipping right
if (this.currentPage < this.totalPages - 1) {
  this.currentPage++;
  this.startFlipRight();
  this.updatePageContent();
}
```

### Page Content Update Example
```javascript
updatePageContent() {
  // Clear existing content
  this.clearPageTextures();
  
  if (this.currentPage === 0) {
    // Render instruction page
    this.renderInstructionPage();
  } else {
    // Render spell page
    const spell = this.spellRegistry.getSpellByPage(this.currentPage);
    if (spell) {
      this.renderSpellPage(spell);
    }
  }
}
```

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to adding a fully-featured spellbook system to your game, with clear separation of concerns and extensibility built in from the start.
