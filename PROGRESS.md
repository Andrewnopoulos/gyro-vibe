I need the game to work for mobile. This means if a player accesses the game and is detected to be a mobile player (who is not using the /mobile endpoint):
- Don't show the QR code at all
- Don't show the initial instructions
- Don't show the multiplayer UI
- Don't show the debug buttons
- Don't show the Controls UI

## Mobile controls:
- virtual joysticks: left side of the screen for moving, right side for rotating the camera
- swiping across the screen: flipping spellbook pages (equivalent to Q and E)
- swiping up: casting the spell (equivalent to tapping the spacebar)
