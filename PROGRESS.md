   - Ensured visual feedback is consistent across components

5. ✅ Connected in FirstPersonController
   - Instantiated WeaponView and GravityGunController together

   - Implemented proper cleanup in dispose() method

### To Be Tested
- Test raycasting in different orientations
- Verify objects can be picked up correctly
- Test in different screen sizes/orientations
- Check for any performance bottlenecks

### Debugging Tips
- Visual indicator at raycast origin shows green when pointing at valid physics objects
- Beam visualization shows the direction and target of the gravity gun
- Press 'V' key to toggle a permanent debug raycast line (red)
- Debug raycast visualization can be disabled in production by setting DEBUG_RAYCAST to false

## Test results (2025-03-19):
- Raycast appears to be pointing from the back of the phone. Please redirect it so that it points from the top
- The raycast indicator might be in the same screen space as the weapon view, when I probably need one in the main world scene as well
- the E key still doesn't appear to be allowing me to interact with physics objects

## Fixes implemented (2025-03-19):
1. **Fixed raycast origin position**:
   - Moved raycast origin to top of phone and more forward from the device
   - Made origin indicator larger and always visible for easier debugging
   - Added a direction line showing which way the raycast points

2. **Improved coordinate transformation between spaces**:
   - Modified mapToWorldSpace to use camera position with proper offsets
   - Added better position/direction calculations for more intuitive aiming
   - Now uses camera's forward direction for more reliable raycasting

3. **Enhanced E key interaction debugging**:
   - Added verbose logging for raycast hits including object information
   - Force a raycast update when E key is pressed for immediate feedback
   - Increased visibility of raycast indicators to help with positioning

4. **Added additional debugging information**:
   - Console logs showing raycast origin and direction
   - Detailed intersection information for physics debugging
   - Visually distinguished raycast origin for clearer identification

## Additional Fixes (2025-03-19):
Based on testing feedback:

1. **Visual Feedback on Physics Objects**:
   - Added visual highlighting of physics objects when raycast intersects them
   - Objects now show a green emissive glow when hit by raycast
   - Highlight persists while objects are being held

2. **Improved Event Communication**:
   - Enhanced gravity gun event data with more detailed information
   - Added objectId and position to pickup events
   - Improved drop event with object reference
   - Added more verbose logging to track event flow

3. **Debug Visualization Cleanup**:
   - Disabled permanent debug raycast visualization (was causing confusion)
   - Removed conflicting direction indicators
   - Made origin indicator smaller and less obtrusive
   - Removed obsolete reticle references

4. **Improved Object Interaction Handling**:
   - Added proper material state management for highlighted objects
   - Ensured original materials are restored when objects are released
   - Fixed event handler to properly support object highlighting
   - Added traverse method to find objects by physics ID

These changes address the issues noted in testing where:
1. The visualizations didn't match the actual raycast behavior
2. There was no visual feedback on the 3D objects when they were hit
3. E key was detecting objects (shown in logs) but feedback was missing


## New Testing:
- That's looking much better in a way
- Now I can see via highlight which object i'm going to pick up

### Next steps
- Now I'd like you to think deeply about this next part:
- The Raycast in world space is still centered on the player's view
- I'd like the raycast to be controlled by the orientation of the weapon in the weapon-view
- Think hard about how to project that orientation into world space
- I want that raycast to be the one to trigger the highlights on the physics rigidbodies

## Weapon-Controlled Raycast Implementation (2025-03-19)

We've fundamentally restructured the raycast system to be driven by the weapon's orientation rather than the camera's view:

1. **Weapon Orientation in World Space**:
   - Added `getWorldDirectionFromWeapon()` method that correctly transforms the weapon's local orientation to world space
   - Used the gyroscope data to determine weapon pointing direction
   - Applied appropriate quaternion transformations to account for different coordinate spaces

2. **Improved Raycast Debug Visualization**:
   - Added a visible green ray in the main scene that shows exactly where the weapon is pointing
   - Ray updates in real-time as the weapon moves
   - Toggle with 'V' key for easy debugging

3. **Accurate Physics Object Targeting**:
   - The raycast now follows the weapon's orientation, not just where the camera is looking
   - Physics objects are highlighted when the weapon points at them
   - Pickup occurs exactly where the weapon is aimed

4. **Fixed Coordinate Space Issues**:
   - Properly transformed between weapon view space and world space
   - Ensured consistent behavior between visual representation and physics interactions
   - Made the raycast origin position more consistent with the visual weapon

5. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Added clearer visual feedback for physics interactions
   - Improved logging to show actual ray direction and hit results
   - Limited update frequency to prevent performance issues from too many raycasts

This implementation correctly projects the weapon's orientation from its local space into world space, ensuring that the raycast direction matches where the weapon is actually pointing.
