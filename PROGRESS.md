ok Claude I figured it out. in addPhysicsShape in physics-utils.js the check on this.physicsManager is always failing so it's returning before adding any physics shape. Can you please fix the initialisation of the PhysicsUtils so that the physicsmanager is connected correctly? I've traced it down to the SceneManager where physics:request-manager is used to fetch the physicsManager. Is there a better way this can be done? I think it's an ordering thing where since the scenemanager is initialised before the physicsmanager, the physicsmanager isn't ready for the scenemanager. This might require a bit of a rework of the architecture / structure of the code. Maybe think about why the physicsmanager is provided with a link to the scenemanager. Can this be leveraged in a useful way?
